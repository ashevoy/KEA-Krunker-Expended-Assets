# Krunker Expanded Assets 2 (WIP)

The Krunker Expanded Assets.zip used to be a compilation of extended assets and resources from Krunker.io and the community catered to Map Designers, Skin/Item Creators, Media Creators/Animators etc. Here's a link to it https://github.com/KrunkerDesignHub/KEA-Krunker_Expanded_Assets

It hasn't been updated since season 4 though. So, I will try my best to update it :)
The original Krunker Modzip is also rarely updated so this will also beat it in terms of updating frequency.

.zip file is on the releases tab
